Recitation notes for Essential Data Structures in C/C++.  These notes are the notes used for the Teaching Assistant-conducted recitations for the Fall 2014 section of this course taught by Jae Woo Lee.

Much of the notes in this repository were compiled from the Spring/Fall 2013 repositories found here: github.com/donyu/cs3136-recitations and github.com/ljc2154/3136_Fall2013_Recitations .

The notes in the original repository were written by the Spring 2013 TAs Louis Croce (Head TA) (@ljc2154), Don Yu (@donyu), and Etan Zapinsky (@etanzapinsky).
